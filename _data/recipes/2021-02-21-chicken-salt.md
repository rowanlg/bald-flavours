Simply over-salt your chicken before roasting then when finished, put on a cooling rack inside a clean backing tray and brush off all the excess salt you can see. Some resiudal juices will drip into the salt and that's what we want.

Remove the chicken and rack so you're left with just the salt in the baking tray. Blitz this salt up and due to its fat content, add it to plain fresh flake salt, similar to the mushroom salt and can be augmented in the same way.

It's a great way to get a roast chicken flavour into a meal without the consumption of one.
