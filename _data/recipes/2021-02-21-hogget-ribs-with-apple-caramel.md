**Ingredients**

Half rack of Hogget ribs

2 Apples nearing their time

Mirepoix salt (or just salt)

Pepper

Cider vinegar

Rosemary and or thyme

**Method**

Remove rack at least an hour before cooking. Pre-heat the oven to 150oC.

Core and wrap apples in foil, onto a tray and into the oven.

Place the rack face down in a large cold frying pan. Bring up to a medium-low heat and start to render out the fat. Keep this going until it's actually gently frying in its own fat. Keep going until it's a deep amber colour all over and fully rendered. Start to infuse this fat with your garlic and herbs. 

Season hogget with your salt, pepper and remaining herbs then place rack in on a tray and into the oven.

Decant the fat in the pan and set aside for a moment. Deglaze the pan with half a pint of water and a slosh of vinegar and start scraping the fond away. Once the apples are roasted to a mush, blitz and add your pan mixture, followed by trickling in all that fat you saved until emulsified and glossy. Keep warm.

Glaze the ribs every 15 mins with this sauce until you can't take it anymore. (After resting).

The spring onion and radishes are totally optional.
