Because I have a deyhdrator and time is now irrelevant, I thought if I'm making crystalised stocks of sorts then why not just do a version of a classic stock base: carrot, onion, celery, garlic and some herbs? 

Slicing very finely, I dehydrated 3 carrots, 2 sticks of celery, 1 onion and 4 cloves of garlic, I lay them out on parchment, covered with salt. Dehydrate/oven on low for as long as it takes to get crisp and shattering.

Blitz and add to fresh damp salt.
