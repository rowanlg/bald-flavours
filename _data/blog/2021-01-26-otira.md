## Marmo

###### The world might be going to heck, but what a handbasket we’re in.

As a man composed of the most fragile genetics, heat and indeed the sun are my only natural predators. I happily while away the day indoors with fans strategically placed and curtains drawn to essentially fashion what many might consider a crypt, or indeed, tomb. Evading the unreasonable heat of a British summer is an art to which I have this piece of sage advice: eating oranges in the shower is one thing but I can absolutely attest to chilled nectarines in a cold shower, lights off. Although my vampiric qualities only extend to draining others of patience, leaving my resting place on summer nights is always a chance to feed.

The Gnocco Fritto™

With the pavement and tarmac still humming with the residual energy of the day, the baked air laced with petrol and chopped grass; suddenly the smell of fags doesn’t cloy so much in the throat somehow. The streets are just the right side of teeming, with those of us who paced ourselves in this unseasonal spasm of heat as to not end up in a deep state of heat exhaustion, slumped up against a bin.

There’s something so enticing about sitting out on a street late into the evening with a dewey carafe, several plates of land air and sea- all glistening with the sort of olive oil that blooms in the mouth and nuzzles your neck on the way down. Lighters stacked flush atop cigarette packets as plumes of oily blue and white smoke twist up into the ether, traced only by candle and streetlight. I’d wistfully made peace with never experiencing anything like this on my own turf but Lo, there was Bar Buvette which has now become Marmo.

Taken on relatively recently and despite drawing on Italian influences more than French, it’s retained the same atmosphere- a microcosm of continental nightlife that Buvette fostered so genuinely.\
Last time at Bar Buvette, I got cocky. Cocky in such a way that I misread the menu and, being not even halfway through my dessert noticed there was a ‘pork, peas, lemon and potato’ dish. As if I was going to waddle out of here without finding out all about this? The plate lands with a thud and I can hear the chubby rasp of Miss Trunchbull in my peripheries. I’m in way over my head.

Quench me.

Foodtigue starts to seep its way in, just in time for this unctuously striated piece of belly. Encased in the sort of deeply burnished crust that a knife scrapes when drawn across but submits instantly to its edge, it’s an absolute specimen. Simply adorned with garden peas and new potatoes waxy and honeysuckle sweet all bathing in buttered pan juices, coursing with fresh lemon. However this is a strain of gluttony that causes you to breathe like a pug because you decided to devote more space to food in your body, than you did oxygen.

The incredible heat that accumulates in these high-ceilings is truly astonishing although Marmo has fans placed where’s possible, the problem is really me. The ever-accomodating staff put us outside so I can pant with my drinking bowl. The gnocco fritto comes into range and despite the pissed up clammer of the feckless dreggs on a Saturday night, they render me deaf. They’re incredible. Try to disagree with this:

Tonnata & saddle. Surf n’ Turf 2.0

Lard-fried unleavened bread, inflated into crispy pillows that have enough of a shell to withstand colossal drapings of coppa, but yield a beautifully gentle and toothsome innard. For a fleeting moment, Antonia and I are taken to a side street of Italy. It’s the most upmarket open-faced ham toastie condensed into the best finger-food that I’ve ever seen and realistically, could ever hope to. It causes the face to collapse with the repletion of the stomach and the soul. Sitting out on the street as another Uber hauls off the daytime casualties and a blacked-out Audi takes a wrong turn and audibly threatens google maps whilst insisting he’ll “be there in ‘two minutes-two minutes, yeah?” which sounds like it’s the 97th times he’s said that. This might not be Venice or Opio but this ‘nightlife’ is authentically British, what I’m helping to ignore it with, most definitely is not.

Now we’re on to hunks of honeyed citrus peach recline amongst the squeaky snap of green beans that have been dressed in a creamy hazelnut dressing with the almost obligatory tears of basil. Understated in its vibrancy, it’s cooling and juicy with a sweet nutty creaminess literally holding it all together. I save a piece of peach to slot into the second plate of gnocco fritto that I’d been planning to get this entire time. I am the master of my domain.

Once again tonnato has found its way to the menu though instead of gracing the mellow acidic quench of beef tomato, it pools itself over ripples of roast pork saddle cold cuts. A clutch of snapping radishes offer that chilled blast of pepper that you’d otherwise be reaching for and all I want to do is order their famous bread and butter separately and fashion a sarnie out of sight on my lap to scuttle home with later as animal I am. Sure, some might say it’s a tuna mayo-cum-Caesar dressing but that providing you’re DTF with the core ingredients it’s a blessing on animal and mineral alike.

Gnocco Fritto II

Cavatelli, pork sausage ragù, mint.

My reason for insisting on al fresco dining is duplicitous- there’s no way I’m going to be able to eat any cavatelli with sausage ragu and mint if my head is roughly the same shade and temperature of a scalded bollock. My little brain rendered twisted by something as simple as fresh mint- it disqualifies the dish from the heavyweight category and instead, is sent gazelle’ing into featherweight. All the homely satiation without anything sticking to the ribs, it’s almost enough to dupe me into biting off more than I can chew but Antonia stays my hand, positing that dessert is probably something that I’d also want two of. There’s not going to be another Porkgate because nobody needs to see that, ever.

We all need an Antonia.

Unlike her assertion that I’d finish uni with a grade that wouldn’t shroud my family name in yet further shame, I did definitely want two of these. Westcombe ricotta and loganberry bacio di Pantelleria a gorgeously ornate Mailliard puck that sandwiches a whipped ricotta that holds like clotted cream but has the manners to let others speak. It’s enveloped from the top down by loganberry jam- heavy on the fruit and more like a rough coulis in texture.

What? You’ve never had a dessert whisper your name?

We circle it indecisively, posturing as if in a knife fight until I come in from above with the back of a spoon and it explodes into streaks of crimson, pink and pearly white. The warmth of the deep-fried pastry fat expands in the mouth keeps you coming back from the puckering of loganberries, soothed with this pure white ricotta. The native British equivalent being the cheese and jam sandwich, of course which we all know is a cornerstone of our rich culinary tapestry.

As the regulatory goalposts currently move daily for many industries, the service industry has arguably received the shittiest end of what is ultimately a stick comprised entirely of shit. I’ve got a real affection for Marmo as it’s taken initiative with such duty of care. It offers something that not many places could boast nor conjure and I don’t just mean all the remote viewing and astral projection it smacks you with. It offers a sense a transparent promise of wanting to feed you in a way that’s loving; like nonna would.

Your brain on drugs. Delicious drugs.

## Jamaica Street Stores

Stokes Croft is what you make it. For some, it’s what Nathan Barley warned us about- for others it’s a thriving hub of independent businesses, hedonism and some decent graffiti from time to time. Whatever your preference, Stokes Croft hasborethe brunt of gentrification with relative aplomb; even Turbo Island got a mural. And even on my worst days, I’ve always got time for a fist bump or hug with Jeff.

I love him. I love you, Jeff.

But things have gotten somewhat bleak in the last couple of years; ghost properties of overseas property magnates remain in stasis and now Hamilton house is under threat. Maybe everything would be OK if Banksy boshed out another piece, or Slix took over Meat Liquor. We’ll see.

Having heard so much about this place, my interest piqued at the mention of Billy Trigg and Charlie James former head chefs at the Ethicurean and River Cottage Cafe, respectively. The whitewashed walls give a clean and beautifully simple feel, that coincides with industrial air vents and hanging lights- the sort of thing that used to make me despise almost every coffee shop in Brighton but here, it convinces me. The lunch menu is pleasingly short and thoughtful, with two plates and a side for ten pounds. No asterisk, no contingent purchase. Just a tenner.

I start with the brown butter, sauerkraut, capers, herb emulsion and breadcrumbs. It’s warm, nutty, sumptuous and livened with the vibrant emulsion. The salty acidity of the capers cut through the heft and play off against the sauerkraut, which is toothsome and tangy- the breadcrumbs tying it all together with a satisfying crunch. Not unlike Oliver Twist, I look up to the waiter who has clearly seen my kind before and almost without prompt, slides me a piece of fresh crusty bread to soak up the rest of the butter.

I think I love him, too.

Within minutes, the caramelised cauliflower, black garlic, mojos and hazelnuts come. The cauliflower is verging on fudgey, with a hint of smoke, the mojos give a rich and bursting kick of peppers, garlic and paprika that in my primitive mind points me towards something like harissa, but with more class. The black garlic sits like torn rizla and I’m careful to make it last with each bite.

My final plate appears and it’s fried chicken, Kim Chi, peanut sambal and macerated kale with a decent lick of habanero mayo. I don’t care where I go or at what level, fried chicken is my*jam.*Instead of a roughly textured batter, it’s a smooth, intense golden brown that has a shatteringly crisp exterior yielding a fluffy and slightly sweet batter, that in turn encompasses extremely juicy thigh meat. As a lover of satay chicken, this dish is a witty tribute; the peanuts sparkle in a sweet and spiced glaze that offers a visceral bite, along with the supple kale that gives the plate balance. Beneath this is a confidently spicy mayonnaise that’s rightfully unapologetic. Once finished, the waiter casually points out that they have a few Pastéis De Nata left and some salted caramel ice cream.

I practically put my finger to his lips and whisper*‘shhh’.*

The bake on the pastry is textbook, the inside meltingly creamy and the ice cream is my ideal- a deep caramel flavour cut with an honest degree of salt with not a single ice crystal to be found, melds all these elements together so moreishly.

I sit, quietly stunned. I signal to the waiter with a dazed look that says I’m ready for the bill. He’s seen that look before, too.

## Otira

I’m sure every city has a stretch of road that makes it famous; Paris has the Champs-Élysées, Vegas has ‘The Strip’ and Hackney has Murder Mile. In terms of food, Bristol has Chandos Road.

Of course, Redland is *nice* but my memories of it aren’t always necessarily- it’s where I first experienced true love and the loss of it. It’s where I meandered beautifully twee streets in a daze, trying to be anywhere but college, as my academic prospects dwindled. Nowhere else do I feel such a sense of comfort spliced with abject loneliness than here; a feeling akin to being left behind on a school trip to a museum- hearing the doors lock before I can catch up to the group, the laughter and chatter disappearing into the world outside. The last time I was here was with someone in whose company I was giddy; ecstatic with the impending bliss of a meal at Wilsons with them. If Chandos Road was a classic bartender, then I was the regular they’d roll their eyes at most nights and would eventually stop calling a taxi for.

Amidst the nagging recalls in my brain, I arrive at a door with softly lit windows and a glow from the kitchen. It’s as if Otira, meaning ‘food for the journey’ in Maori, heard me coming and wanted to take me in from all of this, as well as a particularly cold night. There’s a tapas bar in one half but I’m here for the restaurant in the other.\
An appetiser comes that’s my favourite food of all time- bread and butter. Slightly toasted, the sourdough crumb is dewy, billowy with an elasticity of which I can never cease to revel in tearing from my bite. Accompanying it is abuerrenoisette butter and suddenly I’m home; it’s deeply nutty, sweet, salty and complex.

The first course of smoked eel appears, with a parsnip velouté, parsnip crisp and Japanese pesto. The velouté bowls in on my limbic system as it’s doing the washing up and I’m immediately taken back over two decades to the stands of my rugby club, sodden and cold to the bone, gingerly sipping piping hot parsnip soup- thick, restorative and warm. The eel isn’t heavilysmoked,but is unctuous and firm which contrasts beautifully with the textures of parsnip and the citric pesto.

The second course is violet artichoke, sea buckthorn, radish, kumquat and clementine sorbet. Unfortunately, the sorbet nullifies every other element it’s combined with, rendering them somewhat flavourless and rigid- save for the acerbity of the sea buckthorn. Despite this, the plump and juicy essence of the clementine has been captured wonderfully and reminds me of my Mum; her hands carrying the scent of the zesty oils as we’d share segments in the car coming home from school. I would’ve settled for a bowl of this alone.

The wild mushroom, Venison, brown butter, Chervil root risotto and Porcini is served and any remaining winter chill now thaws completely. The ruby-rare venison sits in a glossy little pool of brown butter, with a rubble of chestnuts- it’s heartily supple and well rested. The risotto is viscous, silky and coarse; elevated by the underlying tang of Parmesan that speaks to the intense subtleties of the Venison- the mushrooms gesturing naturally to a deer’s home, with the addition of myself, gives a sense of a complete food chain.

Dessert is labelled ‘Late Autumn Mess’ comprising of speckled vanilla cream, honeycomb, hunks of marshmallow and pockets of raw passion fruit. The elements differ to those listed, but I am in no way disappointed- it’s a clear demonstration of adaptation on the fly, which is not to be overlooked. The first bite causes me to jolt with stifled laughter as I struggle to suppress a Cheshire Cat grin- it’s all there; creamy, chewy, crunchy, sweet, sour and bitter.

Mute with vivid recollections, my shoulders have dropped and my eyes are resting at half-mast, looking into a pitch black window, my table candle licking at its glass. With a clean plate, I’m pensively thankful for Otira. Whilst it’s still early days, they are earning their place.

Food for the journey, indeed.
