“When it’s brown it’s cooked, when it’s black, it’s fucked” is the binary mantra of, as dubbed by Marina O’Loughlin, ‘Big Sweary’ aka Gordon Ramsay. The increasingly out-of-touch bollock-merchant who can’t handle the fact he’s getting older which, for a man who claims to deal so plainly in bare-faced truths, can’t seem to help but get his filled with Botox. Whether it’s a Roscoff or a delicate piece of salmon, blackening with fire can bring arguably more benefits than losses. If we abided by ‘Sweary in this way, we’d never know the glory of baba ganoush, harissa or burnt ends. Ramsay, like his face, is full of toxic shit.

Showing me everywhere the Taste Cadets haven’t seemingly yet ventured, My Editor has a table for The Coals Rooms up her sleeve- almost condescendingly close to Peckham Rye station (the only real gripe that you can’t roll-up the stairs when full of food and wine very easily). It’s now fully open and having converted to a tasting menu with a new chef plus a wine flight; conditions that cannot breed anticipation thickly enough.

From the bar and seating area, the daylight is upstaged by the theatre of a kitchen that uses open flame. A rank of seats tucked in just on the other side of the pass allows for Chef's-Table-proximity, if, unlike me, you can take the heat. Seated in the main dining area, the mood suddenly changes- from ash to ash wood tones, from flame to cooling cyan-upholstered booths. A couple in the corner are even happier to be here- the necking has started almost instantly.

Equally keen to show off our necking abilities in riposte, we leap straight for the lemon meringue pisco sours. Such an excellent thing to supply in a place that predicates itself on joules, the top comes lightly torched and mimics that tacky-to-the-touch chewy quality in a way that still allows the drink to flow, unhindered.

A course devoted to bread and butter will always be a world I’ll want to live in- cultured butter is all well and good but a jalapeno and thyme ‘country loaf’, still lightly panting from the oven, is a world in which I’ll happily set down my sticks. Rather than a creeping heat, the object seems to be using the pepper for its flavour- a sweetness that holds the lion's share, but only just, with sour bitterness. Then comes one of the most memorable dishes, ‘trio of seasonal tomatoes’- a seductively terse description that cocks an eyebrow.

Plum tomato that’s branded with the hardest sear and a heritage black tomato, simply sliced and slid into place on a tomato and aioli. Dots of tomato gel, toasted black and white sesame seeds and poppy seeds give welcomed pops and chippings of nuttiness but it’s thejalapeñopowder that takes this, deservedly common concept of a dish, somewhere else entirely. The way it absorbs any droplet of juice it comes into contact with and suddenly melts down into a sticky puree, like when missing the right slot for your washing powder.

Aged-beef fat asparagus, wild garlic oil, jalapeño powder, dashi vinegar. ‘It’s all the flavour of a beautiful piece of beef, with none of the heft’ opines My Editor, going on to assert that this is how she’d consume the beast permanently if it wasn’t for all the other qualities inherent to a piece of beef itself. The steeping in such a robust fat allows the spears of asparagus to be scorched and simultaneously lightly fried, maintaining the tenderness within. There’s a pale sauce beneath all of this that tastes like an acidic emulsion of the fat itself, but I’ve become acutely aware that I’ve probably bothered the staff enough for the start of a shift, so I assume it’s from the dashi vinegar that flanks the phalanx. Jalapeño gets another mention, but it’s not overwrought- it offers a steadying hand to a squintingly pleasing dashi vinegar gel.

Coffee kombucha duck, oyster mushrooms, charred sea kale, grits. Grits! Of all things. I erupt then fall to the shoulder of My Editor like a rocket that’s failed to launch. I cannot get enough of when the refined tries to lasso a basic staple into its fold and, when coupled with -and haters will say it’s predictable- an Asian twist on duck by way of kombucha and oyster mushroom, I have no choice but to find out. The textural purpose of the grits here seems to substitute what would usually be a puréed vegetable- beetroot, carrot, potato. On this, it takes a knock, as the only thing slicker here is the coffee kombucha sauce which could do with a small blast of reduction.

The sea kale is charred as promised and is a happy diversion from the radicchio that often takes that role. It’s piled atop the piece of duck which is a reassuring New York pink, perhaps sous-vide and seared last moment. Thinking the mushroom might be cleverly hiding in plain view, it turns out it was forgotten altogether and whilst that might be a Debby Downer to all the righteous plonkers out there; it’s just opened, they’re trying something new and, looking at the bigger picture, something is trying to take shape here and could do with some patience on our behalf, perhaps.

Brawny and firm, the T-bone of brill is adorned with monks beard and just screams ‘I’m Rick James!’. The chimichurri is explosively citrus, the chili kicking a stirrup into you, and you’re glad of it. Resembling mulched grass, it’s not the way I’m used to it- loose and slowly bobbing in glugs of oil- but the sheer fresh intensity of it gets you past the looks and looking for commitment. Fresh pieces of blood orange hang about the plate and, whilst offering a quenching punch of juice, aren’t entirely missed.

Gnocchi, pepper reduction and Grelot onions. This is where I think of old Gordon‘It’s Raw!’ Ramsay. It’s an absolute blindside to have this before dessert, traditionally speaking- clustered with roasted hazelnuts, a slice of long sweet pepper that’s ‘fucked’ on the outside, is supple and fleshy. Essentially being a steam chamber when cooking as a whole, the residual heat and rest has made this plump, fruity and adds moisture to the toothsome gnocchi that’s coated in something like Old Bay. Although it’s yelping for more of a sauce, the hazelnuts offer a tertiary, earthy flavour with resounding syrupy notes that become the catalyst for every subsequent mouthful. The Grelot onions are as blackened as the peppers but haven’t had the tenderising benefit of steam which gives a raw crunch that doesn’t necessarily feel in keeping with the dish. This doesn’t stop us from cleaning the plate with a collective sigh, however.

A surreptitious Google amends my ignorance- ‘Kladdkaka is a popular Swedish chocolate cake. It is a rich chocolate dessert cake with a crisp exterior and a soft and gooey interior. This dense, compact chocolate cake is similar to a chocolate brownie and a molten chocolate cake’.

What’s there to elaborate on? It is exactly this and oozing into ever-absorbed clumps of icing sugar. It’s again no looker, but assimilates into the very core of your being, the way only something like a brownie can. Bitter with cocoa, lifted with dulce de leche and further indulged with the dense cream, it concludes a ride in which all my limbs remain- and I’m ready to go again.

The Coal Rooms reminds me a lot of when Otira opened in Bristol- invigorating ideas that merely suffer from plating and minor issues of execution and to hang on these points, would be to miss the point entirely. Whilst the likes of Ynishir and Casa Mia boast open-flame cookery, I don’t think this place is necessarily trying to compete with that sort of thing. Moreover, they’re deploying not just the heat but the actual flavours that chilies teem with, in a way that’s of course not found in otherwise modern, relatively British, cooking. Fingers firmly crossed for these guys because I think they’re on to something.
