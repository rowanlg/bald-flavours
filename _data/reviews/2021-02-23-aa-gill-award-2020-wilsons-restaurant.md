WILSONS - Sam Wilson AA Gill Award Submission, 2020

What you're about to read could very easily be viewed as an abject failure of analysis, as to write with unwavering bias - because I am in truth, hopelessly in love. Writing about this place is not something I take lightly- I've actively avoided it for years, despite the obsession. Evasion is only due to cowardice- not because of what the reader might think, but because of what I myself might say.

For any of you doubting me already, hold tight- because I've been reduced to shedding single tears over a red mullet and blood orange soup on a dappled summers evening, for instance. The difficulty is, how do you write about a lover- what words will you commit to paper? What if you discover superior synonyms only after submitting a piece which, if successful, will be read by at least one family member and their friend, crystalising an opinion which in a way, holds you to a particular chronological truth centred around something that is constantly evolving? Some may call me pathetic, but they would be unkind people.

My coming to know Wilson's began as a myth. Unanimously recommended by cooks, chefs and writers alike, Jan makes the complex simple and the obvious unseen. Kilner jars incandescent with backlight stand like jewels, beaming ruby and amber hues. Exquisite kombuchas made by a staff member, pickles and ferments all lend to the feeling that even when closed, Wilsons is always working.

Time was, men would follow someone like Jan through smoke and mud, fixing bayonets and holding fast. Despite owning a restaurant, you can still find him in the field aiming for quarry that he will do the honour of using everything it has to offer. The thing is, Wilsons do it without a song and dance. There's no virtue signalling. When COVID kicked off Wilsons was there, offering their food for free to the NHS or donations thereafter. Then saw other restaurants Indian-giving by doing 'boxes' of stuff- some even humbly charging a mere 99 quid, as if to piggyback on these staunch ethics.

I can't help being biased because Jan isn't just running the best restaurant in Bristol- he's my friend. Yes, turning up three times a week might have you say 'well of course, he's a businessman- don't go thinking you're special' well naysayer, I do feel special. Over the years I've seen where my money goes, month on month. He's raising a family with his partner Mary who grows all vegetables that come to a Wilsons plate. So actually yes, Karen, I feel special every time I walk in the door. Every time feels like the first time. The magic has not dissipated in almost four years and I practically relish the fact that I cannot say the same of anywhere else.

Like some sort of weird grandfather, I now get to see other generations enjoying everything I have. I'm excited for them- so of course, I eavesdrop on others- each one at various stages of awe and ecstasy. I see heathens converted, superciliousness humbled and fantasies achieved. I wonder if they know that the kitchen they see is the kitchen they get- the remaining square footage is for the KP. And yet amidst such snug intensities, serene and beautiful dishes emerge on yet more incredible plates and bowls; some webbed with cracks fused together by gold- a Japanese method of reparation known as 'Kintsugi'. That is a fine example of Wilson's philosophy that respects the life of both the living and inanimate.

It's not just the soup that unravels me mentally, it's the Kunekune roasted in fig leaves that displays the allegiance to the mantra of fat meaning flavour. It's the purees which I can ID a mile off as Wilsons- you can barely feel its weight on the fork yet the density of flavour is immobilising, whipping one’s mind to a similar consistency. There’s also a keen focus on biodynamic wines here and it makes perfect sense- the Wilsons philosophy is thoroughly conducive; embrace the asymmetry of nature and above all, respect it and Have faith in your methods. Although I’ve had the same dish more than once before, it has always sat differently- be it an exchange of textures, temperatures or simply another striking method of plating. As maligned as certain techniques are, each have their place and Wilsons lack of ego in this way allows these techniques to be employed with impunity, because Jan and his brigade also know how to use restraint above all else.

There's also this bare-faced and primal belief in not only knowing the origins of your food but the nose-to-tail philosophy. 'Waste is a failure of the imagination' as McMaster opined and whilst even he finds it tricky not having a bin in his restaurant, he's right. Crisp cod skin adorned with whipped cod’s roe and dehydrated scallop roe. A cod’s cheek croquette. Smoked bone broths. Snipe brain. Pigeon offal and cherry sausage rolls, alongside a blushing breast, fat pickled cherries and glowing beetroot all laminated with a jus - the gloss of which I seldom ever see.

Who's so taken by the humble onion that they roast them for almost 2 days to make a consommé to have with a potato mousse so light, that taking anything heavier than a glance to it, feels like mistreatment? Or let’s pray in silence momentarily for the blessings of the souffles - the flavour of which intensely materialises in your mouth before dissipating in the wake of a cold, juicy rush of a sorbet. Fleeing no sooner that it had overwhelmed, from wincingly tart rhubarb to the ruby scoop of a strawberry sorbet plunging into that billowy, pink cloud. Jan and the staff don't know it but they play a significant role in my life. The pleasure of food is a tonic and good for everything that ales me. Tired? Eat. Sad? Eat. Happy? Eat. Bored? Eat. Too awake? Get a ribeye and 50% butter mash down you and see you tomorrow, champ.

Of course, people get the same out of jogging or a puzzle, so...
