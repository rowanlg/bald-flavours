    "content": "As a touring musician in my early twenties, the only viable work to get between touring seasons was in the service industry. I didn’t mind being chewed up and spat out when my time came, as the suffering was always worth playing for. Eventually, however, this took its toll and I began to wonder what exactly have I been doing with my life up until now? Aside from paying bills, all I did was sleep on my days off and looked forward to the end of every 12, 15 or 17 hour day. This was no way to live, so why?\n\nFood.\n\nIt’s because of my simultaneous admiration for chefs and cooks alike, mixed with the utter disdain for the state of the service industry that I began to write about food. I knew what went on behind the front of house and if my food was late, maybe it was because the cook was hurt or just plain forgot. We’re only human. Going out to eat isn’t a right and people forget this. I wanted to write about food sympathetically on the side of those in the industry- it’s easy to be a critic, as TripAdvisor illustrates so bleakly.\n\nIn my own time when I’m not writing, I’m cooking usually just for myself but when I can, for my friends. As pithy as it sounds, food speaks where sometimes you can’t. For those I love, it’s a constant odd stream of consciousness."
